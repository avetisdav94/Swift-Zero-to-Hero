# 🚀 Swift Zero to Hero Journey

This repository documents my path from absolute beginner to **Strong Middle iOS Developer**.
It follows a strict mentorship program focused on **Clean Code**, **Architecture**, and **Real-world practices**.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Progress

### Phase 1: Swift Fundamentals ✅ (Completed)
> Basics, Control Flow, Collections, Functions, and Algorithms.
- [x] Variables, Constants & Types
- [x] Collections (Arrays, Dictionaries) & Loops
- [x] Functions & Control Flow
- [x] **Final Boss:** Text-based RPG Battle System ⚔️

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Swift 🚧 (In Progress)
> The core of iOS development: OOP, Memory Management, and Error Handling.
- [ ] Structs vs Classes (Value vs Reference Types)
- [ ] Optionals & Unwrapping
- [ ] Properties & Methods
- [ ] Protocols & Extensions
